With the data provided, please make this look like the results on the SCP home page (https://streamate.com/?DEBUG_react=1)

Notes:
- Go ahead and assume you can just take an array som instead of:

    {
      "data": 
it would be const data = [.....]
- Want a box with: name, country, and age
- keep in mind that the boxes resize and have maybe a 1px space around all sides
  + make them gray with white text and have the page background be black

Requirements:
- render a grid of gray boxes that resize with the page and have 1px of space on all sides
- white text with name, country, and age 
  + also place their status in the upper right (maybe style this like how goldshow shows up on that page with red for offline and green for online)
- black background
- link 'show only US models'
